<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 FX-Mame a glide driver for xmame</A>
</H2>

<P>The latest version of this driver can be obtained at: 
<A HREF="http://glmame.linuxgames.com">http://glmame.linuxgames.com</A><H3>Requirements</H3>

<P>To run FXmame you must have:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A 3Dfx card</LI>
<LI>Glide 2x o the xmame distribution</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Compiling and Installing</H3>

<P>FXmame comes in two flavours -- xfx and svgafx. The xfx version is designed
to run under X11. It uses an X window for input. The svgafx version runs from
the console, and uses svgalib for input. Both use the 3Dfx hardware for rendering.
<P>To install FXmame, follow the general instructions for installing xmame.
To specify the glide driver, do the following the Makefile:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Select either &quot;xfx&quot; or &quot;svgafx&quot; as your display method</LI>
<LI>Configure the glide variables to correspond to your glide setup</LI>
</UL>
<P>The FXmame executables are called &quot;xmame.xfx&quot; and &quot;xmame.svgafx&quot;
<H3>Running</H3>

<P>FXmame runs with the same parameters and uses the same keyboard commands
that xmame.x11 does.
<P>A few extra keyboard commands have been added in the glide driver:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>RIGHTCTRL-A -- toggle antialiasing in vector games </LI>
<LI>RIGHTCTRL-B -- toggle bilinear filtering</LI>
</UL>
<P>The glide driver also adds several command-line options:
<P>
<PRE>
    -fxgama &lt;value&gt; 3Dfx gamma correction value
</PRE>
<P>Note that in order to display the game options or the fps display in vector
games, I have to overlay the game bitmap over the vector display. This is because
I circumvent the bitmap entirely in vector games. Drawing the bitmap is a big
cpu hog, so you'll notice that the game slows down when you turn on the fps
display (I know, not ideal when you want to find out the frame rate...)
<H3>Common Questions (FAQ)</H3>

<P>Q: When I run FXmame, it just dumps core.
<P>A: Make sure you are running FXmame as root. Root priviledges are required
to access the 3Dfx hardware
<P>Q: When I run xmame.xfx, it just hangs at the initial game screen
<P>A: Are you running KDE? For some reason, I can't get keyboard input under
KDE. If you have this problem, switch window managers or use xmame.svgafx instead.
<H3>Present Limitations/Bugs</H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>antialiasing isn't working quite as well as it should o input problems
under KDE</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Future Work</H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Optimize the drawing code to update only the changed portions of the game
bitmap.</LI>

</H2>

<P>The latest version of this driver can be obtained at: 
<A HREF="http://glmame.linuxgames.com">http://glmame.linuxgames.com</A><H3>Requirements</H3>

<P>To run GLmame you must have:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>An OpenGL implementation</LI>
<LI>libjpeg</LI>
<LI>hardware 3D acceleration (if you want any kind of framerate) o the xmame
distribution</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Compiling and Installing</H3>

<P>Follow the general instructions for installing xmame. To specify the OpenGL
driver, do the following in the Makefile:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Select &quot;xgl&quot; as your display method</LI>
<LI>Configure the OpenGL variables to correspond to your OpenGL implementation</LI>
<LI>Configure the CABDIR variable</LI>
</UL>
<P>The GLmame executable is called &quot;xmame.xgl&quot;
<H3>Running</H3>

<P>xmame.xgl runs with the same parameters and uses the same keyboard commands
that xmame.x11 does.
<P>The program starts up in cabinet mode. While this is pretty, and cool,
you'll probably want to actually play in fullscreen mode.
<P>A few extra keyboard commands have been added in the OpenGL driver:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>RIGHTCTRL-B -- toggle bilinear filtering</LI>
<LI>RIGHTCTRL-C -- toggle cabinet/fullscreen display</LI>
<LI>RIGHTCTRL-T -- toggle phosphor trails --use at your own risk! -- it works
best if double buffering is disabled (see below)</LI>
</UL>
<P>The OpenGL driver also adds several command-line options:
<P>
<PRE>
    -[no]dblbuffer          Disable/enable double buffering
    -cabview                Start in cabinet view mode
    -nocabview              Start in fullscreen view mode
    -cabinet &lt;cabname&gt;      Use the cabinet model &lt;cabname&gt;
    -fxgama &lt;value&gt;         3Dfx gamma correction value
</PRE>
<P>Two cabinet models are provided. The default, &quot;glmame&quot;, is designed
to look like a standard arcade cabinet. The other, &quot;trans&quot;, is a
box with a transparent games screen that you can see through.
<P>Note that in order to display the game options or the fps display in vector
games, I have to overlay the game bitmap over the vector display. This is because
I circumvent the bitmap entirely in vector games. Drawing the bitmap is a big
cpu hog, so you'll notice that the game slows down when you turn on the fps
display (I know, not ideal when you want to find out the frame rate...) This
overlaying seems to have some glitches in cabinet mode. I don't know what causes
them.
<P><B>*** IMPORTANT! ***</B>
<P>If you have trouble with GLmame, or it is slow, read the &quot;Common Questions&quot;
section. Most of the questions people email me are answered here.
<H3>Cabinet Models</H3>

<P>Cabinet model information is stored in the &quot;cab&quot; subdirectory
of the directory you specified with the ROMPATH variable in the Makefile. Path
information specified in xmamerc or with the 'rompath' shell environment variable
is currently not used. Each cabinet model has it's own subdirectory. GLmame
will first try to load either the user-specified cabinet model (using the -cabinet
command-line option), or a model corresponding to the current game name. Failing
that, it will use the generic &quot;glmame&quot; model.
<P>A cabinet model directory must contain a geometry file &lt;modelname&gt;.cab,
and any .jpg files used for textures on the model. The format of the .cab file
will be familiar if you have ever programmed using OpenGL -- it looks much
like an OpenGL display list. The format is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
    cabv1.0
</PRE>
<P>This header must be the first 7 characters of the file.
<P>
<PRE>
    #&lt;text&gt;
</PRE>
<P>Comment lines begin with '#'
<P>
<PRE>
    begin &lt;type&gt;
</PRE>
<P>Begins a geometry object, where type is one of (polygon, quads, quad_strip,
screen). Each &quot;begin&quot; must be paired with an &quot;end&quot; statement.
A &quot;polygon&quot; is specified using one vertex per, well... vertex. &quot;quads&quot;
are four-sided polygons, each specified by four vertices in order around the
polygon. A &quot;quad_strip&quot; is a series of four-sided polygons, each
of which shares an edge with the polygons before and after it in the strip.
A &quot;screen&quot; is a quad that defines the actual area in 3D space where
the game will be displayed. only one of these should be defined. For more info,
look at any description of OpenGL geometry.
<P>
<PRE>
    end
</PRE>
<P>Ends the geometry object begun with &quot;begin&quot;.
<P>
<PRE>
    color4 &lt;r&gt; &lt;g&gt; &lt;b&gt;
</PRE>
<P>Changes the current color to the corresponding rgb value (specified as
floating point numbers between 0 and 1).
<P>
<PRE>
    color4 &lt;r&gt; &lt;g&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;a&gt;
</PRE>
<P>Changes the current color to the corresponding rgba value (specified as
floating point numbers between 0 and 1).
<P>
<PRE>
    shading &lt;type&gt;
</PRE>
<P>Sets the shading type. available types are &quot;smooth&quot; (which blends
colors from one vertex to the next) or &quot;flat&quot; (which doesn't).
<P>
<PRE>
    vertex &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; &lt;z&gt;
</PRE>
<P>Specifies a vertex for the current geometry object as a point in 3-space.
<P>
<PRE>
    numtex &lt;num&gt;
</PRE>
<P>Specifies the number of different textures to be loaded. This declaration
must precede any &quot;loadtex&quot; call.
<P>
<PRE>
    loadtex &lt;num&gt; &lt;width&gt; &lt;height&gt; &lt;filename&gt;
</PRE>
<P>Loads texture number &lt;num&gt; from .jpg file &lt;filename&gt;. The .jpg
file *must* be &lt;width&gt; by &lt;height&gt; pixels, and both &lt;width&gt;
and &lt;height&gt; must be powers of two (and must conform to the hardware
requirements of any 3D card you want the cabinet to work with -- 256x256 for
3Dfx).
<P>
<PRE>
    texcoord &lt;xcoord&gt; &lt;ycoord&gt;
</PRE>
<P>Sets the texture coordinate of the next vertex. This specifies where in
2D texture space the vertex lies.
<P>
<PRE>
    enable texture
</PRE>
<P>Enables texture mapping (using the currently-selected texture).
<P>
<PRE>
    disable texture
</PRE>
<P>Turns off texture mapping.
<P>
<PRE>
    settex &lt;num&gt;
</PRE>
<P>Select texture &lt;num&gt; for doing texturing. The texture must previously
have been loaded using &quot;loadtex&quot;.
<P>
<PRE>
    camerapan &lt;num&gt;
</PRE>
<P>Starts the camera pan definition that will be followed by &lt;num&gt; camera
transistions. After the last transision definition, the pan sequence must be
ended with an &quot;end&quot; statement.
<P>
<PRE>
    goto &lt;lx&gt; &lt;ly&gt; &lt;lz&gt; &lt;px&gt; &lt;py&gt; &lt;pz&gt; &lt;nx&gt; &lt;ny&gt; &lt;nz&gt;
</PRE>
<P>Relocates and reorients the camera. The arguments are the same as are used
by the OpenGL command &quot;gluLookAt()&quot;. The camera is positioned at
point &lt;lx,ly,lz&gt;, pointing along vector &lt;px,py,pz&gt;, with &quot;up&quot;
normal (the direction that is &quot;up&quot; for the camera) &lt;nx,ny,nz&gt;.
<P>
<PRE>
    moveto &lt;lx&gt; &lt;ly&gt; &lt;lz&gt; &lt;px&gt; &lt;py&gt; &lt;pz&gt; &lt;nx&gt; &lt;ny&gt; &lt;nz&gt; &lt;frames&gt;
</PRE>
<P>Moves the camera to a new location (specified as in &quot;goto&quot;).
The transition occurs over &lt;frames&gt; frames.
<P>All commands must be on separate lines. Use the (somewhat) commented glmame
cabinet as an example to work from.
<H3>Common Questions (FAQ)</H3>

<P>Q: I am only getting a few frames-per-second. This sucks! What gives?
<P>A1: You're probably running Mesa in software mode. You should read the
&quot;README.3Dfx&quot; file in the Mesa distro. Specifically, you need to
&quot;setenv MESA_GLX_FX fullscreen&quot;
<P>A2: You don't have a 3D graphics card. Go buy one!
<P>Q: When I run xmame.xgl, it just dumps core. That's not as much fun as
3D Pacman, now is it?
<P>A1: If you are using a 3Dfx card, make sure you are running xmame.xgl as
root. Root priviledges are required to access the 3Dfx hardware
<P>A2: If you're using Mesa and haven't upgraded to v3.0, do so.
<P>Q: When I run xmame.xgl, it just hangs at the initial game screen
<P>A: Are you running KDE? For some reason, I can't get keyboard input under
KDE. If you have this problem, switch window managers

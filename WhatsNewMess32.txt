- MESS32 will now remember what items were selected in the software picker.
  [Nate Woods]

- Unknown file types are no longer displayed in software pane.  Unknown ZIPs
  will now be X'ed [Nate Woods]

- Added "Open Other Software..." and "Create Image" menu items so that
  software not in the software directory can be used (similar to the pre 37b5
  mechanism) [Nate Woods]

- Fixed a few minor file bugs [Nate Woods]

- Added a "Modified/Hacked" item in the treeview [Nate Woods]

- Added support for custom icons for different software types.  These icons
  must have the following names:

  cart.ico for cartridges
  flop.ico for floppies
  hard.ico for hard drives
  cass.ico for cartridges
  snap.ico for snapshots
  quik.ico for quick loads

  To make these icons show up, they must be placed in a subdirectory of the

  cartridges would have the path "nes/cart.ico" [Nate Woods]

Whats new:

----------
0.37 BETA 15
------------

This likely will be the last MESS32 release based on the classic MESS32 source code.  Further releases will have the MESS32 UI added onto the base Win32 MESS releases.

- Added a new MESS32-specific file manager. [Nate Woods]
- Fixed a bug in "other directory software" selected through a file dialog.
  [Nate Woods]
- Added the ability for the software view to lookup information from the .crc
  files and display them in different columns, as well as the ability to move
  columns in the software view similar to the system view.  [Nate Woods]
- The main view will now display screenshots pertaining to software items; not
  just systems.  These screenshots must be placed in subdirectories with names
  matching the system off of the snapshots directory, and be named the same as
  the software item.  [Nate Woods]
- Worked around optimization bugs in the tms9900 so the TI99 system finally
  works properly. [Nate Woods]

----------
0.37 BETA 13
------------

- Properties dialog now causes software pane to refresh only if the software
  paths are modified. [Nate Woods]
- Fixed a bug that could cause crashes if too many images were selected in the
  software pane. [Nate Woods]
- Updated MESS32 to properly recognize the new device types (cylinders, punch
  cards and punch tapes) introduced with the ApexC driver. [Nate Woods]
- Fixed a minor bug that caused crashes when opening images without file
  extensions, as well as causing crashes with the C128 driver. [Nate Woods]

----------
0.37 BETA 11
------------

- Fixed a bug that could cause software to be improperly selected if it was
  selected, unselected, and MESS32 restarted. [Nate Woods]
- Fixed MESS32 so that it looks for sysinfo.dat instead of history.dat and
  sysbug.dat instead of mameinfo.dat [Nate Woods]

----------
0.37 BETA 10
------------

- Updated MESS32 to use makefile.vc as per MAME32 [Nate Woods]

----------
0.37 BETA 9
------------

- MESS32 will now remember what items were selected in the software picker.
  [Nate Woods]

- Unknown file types are no longer displayed in software pane.  Unknown ZIPs
  will now be X'ed [Nate Woods]

- Added "Open Other Software..." and "Create Image" menu items so that
  software not in the software directory can be used (similar to the pre 37b5
  mechanism) [Nate Woods]

- Fixed a few minor file bugs [Nate Woods]

- Added a "Modified/Hacked" item in the treeview [Nate Woods]

- Added support for custom icons for different software types.  These icons
  must have the following names:

  cart.ico for cartridges
  flop.ico for floppies
  hard.ico for hard drives
  cass.ico for cartridges
  snap.ico for snapshots
  quik.ico for quick loads

  To make these icons show up, they must be placed in a subdirectory of the
  icons directory that matches the name of the driver.  Thus an icon for NES
  cartridges would have the path "nes/cart.ico" [Nate Woods]

- Fixed a bug that caused ROMless drivers to be marked as "Missing ROMs" [Nate
  Woods]

- Added driver-specific software paths to the properties window [Nate Woods]

- New GUI with a software picker (No more Image 0-3 menu!) [Nate Woods]

- Worked around a MSFT compiler bug that caused the emulation to stop on the
  disclaimer screens. [Nate Woods]

- This is not a part of the MESS32 release, it is worth talking about:  There
  is now a MESS32 picture archive being hosted at the following URL:

- The MESS32 executable and DLL is now UPXed (Ultimate Packer for eXecutables).
  See http://upx.tsx.org/ for details about UPX. [Nate Woods]

- Fixed a stupid bug that caused opening writable images (like floppies) to
  fail. [Nate Woods]

- Added new icons and graphics. [Ohso]

- Added standard command line options for images. [Nate Woods]

- Directory category for screenshots is now called Pictures (even if the
  directory defaults to images). [Nate Woods]

- Fixed a bug that could cause opening non-zipped images to fail [Kev Thacker]

- Removed samples directory and corresponding UI since no MESS drivers use
  samples. [Nate Woods]

- Switched to using the C 68k CPU core so that the Mac Plus driver works. [Nate
  Woods]

- Changed references to the word "Game" to "System". [Nate Woods]

- Removed unneccesary sound and CPU cores. [Nate Woods]

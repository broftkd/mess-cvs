NEC PC-8801 series
------------------

early Z80 based computer commonly used in Japan

Features
--------
main Z80 CPU 4MHz(some models has 8MHz version)
sub Z80 CPU 4MHz(for 5'floppy disk drive)
64KB RAM
48KB Video RAM
640x200 8colors or B/W graphics
640x400 B/W graphics(required "high-resolution" display(VSYNC 24KHz))
80x25 text(alphabet or Kata-kana only, can overlay on graphics)
YM-2203 or YM-2608 FM sound(some models or optional)
extended RAM(various size, some models or optional)
5'2D or 5'2HD or 8'2D floppy disk drives(some models or optional)

printer port

MESS emulation state
--------------------
CPU
text or graphics
YM-2203 sound(YM-2608 not yet)
extended RAM
5'2D disk drives
Kanji ROM
Note: Currently, each model is separated which use "High-resolution"
      display and "Low-resolution" display. Beacause I don't know how
      to change display resolution and HSYNC frequency dynamically
      (when machine is running).

ROM
---
BIOS images has same format as one of images for M88 emulator, but
"disk.rom" is only used first 2K bytes, that is, you must truncate
last 6KB of "disk.rom". M88 emulator and BIOS tools can be downloaded
from this:

	http://www.remus.dti.ne.jp/~cisc/m88/

Currently PC-8801mkIISR rom is only tested.

Disk Emulation
--------------
The D88 format disk image is supported now, but multiple disks image
files are not supported, That is, disk in image file must be only
one. The D88 disk image format is supported by more PC-8801
emulators. Tools for D88 format can be downloaded from these:

TODO
----
integrate "high-resolution" and "low-resolution" mode
optimization of CPU switching
more accurate speed(memory wait and DMAC overhead)
YM-2608 sound
joystick and mouse
5'2HD or 8'2D floppy disk drives
font substitution
Kana-Kanji dictionary ROM
test ROMs of other models
multiple disks image support
source clean-up
printer
RS-232C
CD-ROM
more good English document

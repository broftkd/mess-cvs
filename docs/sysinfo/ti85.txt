Texas Instruments TI-85
-----------------------

The TI-85 was designed as a powerful engineering and calculus calculator.
It was the first TI calculator to have a link port and assembly programming
capability (through an unintentional loophole). It has since been eclipsed by
the TI-86, which features TI-85 compatibility along with more advanced features.

   emulator written by Rusty Wagner.
3. NVRAM is saved properly only when calculator is turned off during MESS
   exiting.
4. To receive data from TI press "R" immediately after TI starts to send data.
5. To send data to calculator start receiving on TI and choose file from
   Built-in File Manager.
6. To request screen dump from calculator press "S".

To do:
- port 3 and 4
- better artworks
- drivers for rom versions: 1.0, 2.0, 7.0

Needed:
1. Info about ports 3 (bit 2 seems to be allways 0) and 4.
2. High quality artwork.

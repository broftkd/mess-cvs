Texas Instruments TI-86
-----------------------

Just as the TI-83 succeeded the TI-82, the TI-86 followed up on the TI-85's
advanced functionality while adding a stylish new case, assembly support
similar to that of the TI-83, and greater memory capacity, while still
maintaining compatibility with TI-85 programs.

Notes:
1. After start TI-86 waits for ON key interrupt, so press ON key to start
   calculator.
2. Video engine (with grayscale support) based on the idea found in VTI source
   emulator written by Rusty Wagner.
3. NVRAM is saved properly only when calculator is turned off during MESS exiting.
4. To receive data from TI press "R" immediately after TI starts to send data.
5. To send data to calculator start receiving on TI and choose file from
   Built-in File Manager.
6. Homebrew rom by Daniel Foesch does nothing but showing charset. 

To do:
- many corrections of existing code
- port 3 and 4
- better artworks
- driver for rom version 1.2

Needed:
1. Info about ports 3 (bit 2 seems to be allways 0) and 4.
2. High quality artwork.
3. Dumps of rom version 1.2

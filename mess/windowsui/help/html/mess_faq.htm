		<p class="topic">What makes <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> different from other emulators?/Why yet another 
			emulator?</p>
		<p>
			The main difference is that it supports many different kinds of computers and 
			consoles, not just one like most emulators. <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> is also open source, which 
			means it's free and anyone who knows the C programming language can help with 
			the project. Also, <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>' architecture makes it easy to add lesser known systems 
			that no one would care enough about to emulate and preserve otherwise. The main 
			difference, however, is the goals of the project. Most standalone emulators 
			have the goal of letting you play games for whatever system on your PC. Because 
			their main goal is playability, they often include speed hacks and fudge things 
			so that most games run fast but a few games won't work. <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>' philosophy is to 
			behave <u>exactly</u> like the original hardware, even if it's incredibly slow, 
			so that <u>all</u> software for the original machine will work. This tends to 
			make <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> a fair bit slower than other emulators, but this is not always true.
		</p>
		<p class="topic">Isn't <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> the same as <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a>?</p>
		<p>
			No. <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> is based on <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a>, and uses the same underlying engine, but its goals 
			are different. To put it simply, <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a> is for arcade machines, and <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> is for 
			home computers and video game consoles.
		</p>
		<p class="topic">How do I install <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>?</p>
		<p>
			Download the version for your machine, and decompress it into a new folder 
			named <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>, or you can put it in the same folder as <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a> (it's OK to overwrite 
			any files in the <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a> folder with the same name as the <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> files - they *are* 
			the same). Make sure you choose the option in your compression program to 
			recreate the directory structure. What's that? Don't have a compression 
			program? For Windows, go to <a href="http://www.winzip.com">http://www.winzip.com/</a>, 
			for DOS, do a search for PKWARE, for UNIX/Linux, your system should come 
			utilities called gunzip and tar, and for Macs, do a search for StuffIt 
			Expander. On UNIX/Linux, you'll probably need to compile it before you can run 
			it. If you don't know how to do that, ask your local guru, but if you don't 
			know you really shouldn't be using UNIX in the first place. After that, you'll 
			need to pick up some ROMs.
		</p>
		<p class="topic">What's a ROM?/What's a disk image?/Where do I get ROMs?/How do I 
			use my old software with <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>?</p>
		<p>
			In most cases, old software is physically incompatible with modern computers. 
			No matter how hard you push, an Atari cartridge just plain won't fit in your 
			computer's floppy drive. Folding up old 5 1/4" diskettes so they fit in a 3 
			1/2" drive will only break your disks. Obviously there's a problem here - how 
			do I get that software into my PC so an emulator can use it?
		</p>
		<p>
			It's possible to build special cartridge reading devices for console systems 
			and hook up old computers to new ones to transfer floppy disks. These media get 
			transferred into files on the new computer. These files are called ROMs for 
			cartridges, and images for floppies and tapes and such, all though most people 
			just call them all ROMs. There are also system ROMs inside most computers and 
			consoles, on little integrated circuit chips (those black rectangles with all 
			the pins that look like centipedes). These, too can be read out with the proper 
			equipment.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, originally emulation was just for hobbyists who had all this special 
			equipment, but some of them put these ROMs up on the Internet for people to 
			download, on the honor system that people would only download the ROMs that 
			they owned the original software for. Unfortunately, a lot of people came along 
			who just wanted to download free games and didn't care about preservation, and 
			gave the emulation community a bad name among software companies. There are 
			many ROM sites on the Internet, using a search engine should turn up the ones 
			you want. But remember: downloading ROMs that you don't own is illegal. Some 
			people say that the copyrights have expired or that you can download it if you 
			delete it after 24 hours, but they are wrong. It's up to you whether you want 
			to ignore the law, as most of the games are not and will not ever be sold 
			again.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most systems require system ROMs. <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> is very picky about its system ROMs -- 
			they must be exactly the ones it is expecting, otherwise it will complain and 
			probably won't work.
		</p>
		<p class="topic">Okay, I got some ROMs, now where do I put them?</p>
		<p>
			System ROMs should go, still zipped, in the BIOS subfolder of wherever you put 
			<a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>. Game ROMs should go into the SOFTWARE\[system name] folder. They can 
			still be zipped, but only one ROM per zip file. The system name is an 
			abbreviated identifier for the system, it is the same as the name of the system 
			ROM zip file from messroms.de. Run <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> with the -listfull option to find out 
			all the abbreviations.
		</p>
		<p class="topic">All right, I did all that, now how do I run <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>?</p>
		<p>
			It depends on what version you have. For DOS, type "mess [system] [game] 
			[options]", where system is the system abbreviation, game is the filename of 
			the ROM, and options are command line options listed in the readme.txt and 
			mess.txt files. For UNIX/Linux, do the same thing except the name of the 
			program is xmess. For Windows and Macs, just run the program and click on the 
			systems and games you want to run--it's pretty easy. If it asks you for your 
			soundcard, choose Sound Blaster or Windows Sound System. Most people don't have 
			those other ones.
		</p>
		<p class="topic">I did everything just like you said, but it still doesn't work!</p>
		<p>
			There is a messageboard you can go to for help at <a href="http://mess.emuverse.com/">
				http://mess.emuverse.com</a>. But first, make sure you read this FAQ, the 
			readme.txt, and mess.txt. The answers can often be found there. Also check out 
			the <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a> FAQ at http://www.mame.net --it's a very good resource for things 
			common to <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a> and <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>, such as sound and graphics setup. Also search through 
			the messageboard to see if somebody already had the same problem. And at least 
			put some effort into fixing it yourself. People on messageboards can get very 
			annoyed with people who ask questions that have already been answered 
			elsewhere, especially in readme.txt and mess.txt.
		</p>
		<p class="topic">It works, but it's way too slow!</p>
		<p>
			Because of <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>' goal of compatibility over speed, this is often the case. You 
			might think that your computer should be able to emulate such old machines at 
			full speed, but keep in mind that your computer is doing the jobs of <b>every chip</b>
			in the original machine, not just the CPU. Your CPU is doing the jobs of the 
			CPU(s), graphics chip(s), sound chip(s), as well as any other special hardware 
			present in the original machine, so it can be bogged down fairly easily, 
			especially by the relatively unoptimized <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> core. <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> is written almost 
			entirely in C, not assembly, for compatibility reasons. There are some tweaks 
			you can do to speed up the performance a bit (see the <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a> FAQ), but if you 
			need a big boost, there's not much you can do except buy a faster computer, 
			wait for an update (not likely), or use another emulator.

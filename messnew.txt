New System Drivers Supported (in no particular order):
------------------------------------------------------
Dragon 64 [Nate Woods]

System Driver Changes:
----------------------
- [GAMEBOY] Sound Emulation - Mode 1 is 99%, sweep code needs more work, 
  Mode 2 is 100%, no Mode 3. and Mode 4 sounds good.  Added NVRAM support 
  for MBC2 MBC3 and MBC5 carts.  A lot more games work now, including the 
  pokemon series (except pokemon pinball) and Zelda DX, and most GBC games 
  now show a "this game only works on GBC" screen.  MBC3 still needs the 
  RTC emulated and MBC5 doesn't handle high memory addressing yet.  Added 
  support for battery backed ram, so Zelda can be played now :), and sprites 
  no longer have inverted colours in some games (like zelda, warioland etc).
  Several bugzilla fixes.   [Anthony Kruize]
  
- [CGENIE] Floppy initialisation fixed for when no floppy attached 
  (Bug #95) [Ben Bruscella]

- [JUPITER] Cartridge and Cassette Initialisation fixed 
  (Bug #126) [Ben Bruscella]

- [A7800] Fixed interrupt handling bug - more carts run again [Ben Bruscella]

- [SPECTRUM] 48k machines are now able to run code in screen memory (Bug #46).
  Fixed problem with interrupt vector set to 0xffff (much more 128k games works
  now). Corrected frames per second value for 48k and 128k Sincalir machines.
  Remaped some Spectrum+ keys. Added support to load .SP snapshots. Added .BLK
  tape images support. [Krzysztof Strzecha]

- [COCO] Converted CoCo drivers to use configurable RAM sizes, and the CoCo 3
  driver now supports the 2 MB upgrade (if I knew the specs, it would be very
  trivial for me to support the 8 MB upgrade). [Nate Woods]
  
- [COCO] Fixed a bug in DMK disk image on little endian machines. (Bug #179)
  [Nate Woods]

- [PC] Fixed a bug that caused the keyboard buffer to get flooded and the
  emulated system to get paralyzed in beeping under certain situations (bug
  #151). [Nate Woods]

- [TS1000] The main rom file is now called zx81a.rom, instead of zx81.rom in
  order to match the other drivers in the family. [Nate Woods]

- [COCO3] Added support for Jeff Vavsaour's virtual hard disk. His Color
  Computer 3 emulator comes with an OS-9 driver. [tim lindner]

Source Changes:
---------------
- The core is based on MAME 0.56.  This incorporates all features of the 
  update to this core.  [MAME team] 

- The core now supports configurable RAM sizes; drivers can expose RAM
  configurations (e.g. 4k, 16k, 32k etc) and on Windows, this setting is
  exposed through a command line switch -ramsize.  [Nate Woods]

- Fixed a bug that prevented introducing completely new software images when
  there was already one of that particular image type already loaded. [Nate
  Woods]

- Added some infrastructure for automated tests. [Nate Woods]

- Fixed a bug in tape handling that would cause rewind and fast forward to not
  work if the system was stopping the tape (bug #168). [Nate Woods]

- [Windows] Fixed a bug in the core that caused the MESS process to not die if
  the close box was pressed, and the UI was disabled (bug #170). [Nate Woods]
 
- [Windows] Fixed a bug in the GUI that caused heap corruptions. [Nate Woods]

- [Windows] Fixed a bug in the GUI that caused auditing to report BIOS-less
  console systems as missing BIOSes. [Nate Woods]

- [IMGTOOL/Windows] Added wildcard support in the put command, since the
  Windows shell doesn't do this by default. [Nate Woods] 
  
- [IMGTOOL/FAT driver] Fixed bug where files would get stored into a FAT image
  without forcing the filename to upper case. [Nate Woods]

- [MacMESS] Added configurable RAM sizes and dipswitch controls to the MESS
  tab. [tim lindner]

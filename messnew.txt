Source Changes:

  [Nate Woods]

- [Windows] Default directories for the file dialogs can now be specified on
  a device type basis at the command line (e.g. -floppydisk_dir).  This
  option will get written out when launched from the GUI, so that per system
  directories can be recorded (bug #345). [Nate Woods]

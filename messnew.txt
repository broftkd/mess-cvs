0.61.1

New System Drivers Supported (in no particular order):
------------------------------------------------------

System Driver Changes:
----------------------
- [COCO1] Update CRC for bas10.rom. Previous dump was bad. [tim lindner]

- [COCO1/2] Made the hi-res joystick interface available to the CoCo 1-2 [Nate
  Woods]

- [COCO1/2/3] Moved disk handling code over to new FormatDriver system;
  allowing transparent disk image handling for JVC, VDK, and DMK file formats.
  [Nate Woods]

- [DRAGON64] Fixed a bug that prevented the system to run (the dragon64 driver
  was using the coco memory map) [Nate Woods]

Source Changes:
---------------
- The MESS core will not automatically open software images in a clone system
  drivers directory anymore, under the belief that this functionality belongs
  in the OSD code. [Nate Woods]

- All MESS drivers need a SYSTEM_CONFIG (formerly COMPUTER_CONFIG) parameter
  specified.  Also changed the implementation of the SYSTEM_CONFIG_* macros to
  provide a more flexible system for representing the data.

  Added the ability for devices to be declared within the SYSTEM_CONFIG block.
  Consider the older way of declaring devices deprecated.

  Added new functions for iterating through devices, in order to better
  abstract the internal representation of devices:
  
	device_first()
	device_next()
	device_find()
		
  Also renamed GameDriver dev field to dev_ in order to break any source
  dependencies on the dev field. [Nate Woods]
  
- Overhaul of code that maintained the list of loaded images; moved to
  mess/image.[c|h], and changed the prefix of them from device_ to image_ (as
  opposed to the device_* calls that are used to access the IODevice
  structure).  Also, implemented these new calls for drivers to use:
  
	image_malloc()    (similar to auto_malloc(), but for the lifetime of devices)
	image_strdup()    (uses image_malloc() to allocate strings)
	image_exists()    (tests for the existance of a loaded image)
	image_filetype()  (accessor for file extension)

  For the most part, there is no longer any reason for MESS drivers to use
  malloc() and free(), so calls to these should be eliminated over time. [Nate
  Woods]
  
- Removed IO_RESET_ALL, as it was broken and an ugly hack to begin with (bug
  #239) [Nate Woods]

- In the opening display software info box, if the filename and the goodname
  (as determined by CRC) match up, the goodname will not be displayed in
  order to reduce screen clutter. [Nate Woods]
  
- Removed all calls to device_close(IO_CASSETTE) in system drivers, instead
  provided a cassette_exit() function that drivers can specify, removing this
  responsibility from system drivers. [Nate Woods]

- [Win32 GUI] Printers are now treated separately from the other devices; you
  do not specify printer ouput like you do disk images.  Printer output now
  gets specified in the configuration tab of the system properties.  The added
  benefit is that the same output file can be used repeatedly. [Nate Woods]

- [Imgtool] Imgtool floppy drivers can now be "templated"; a driver for a
  particular file system format can point at a structure that lists allowable
  disk image formats.  This allows for the addition of new disk image format
  drivers without touching the imgtool drivers. [Nate Woods]

New System Drivers Supported (in no particular order):
------------------------------------------------------
- Super GameBoy [Anthony Kruize]
- GameBoy Color (preliminary) [Anthony Kruize]
- Innumerable Sega Master System Variants [Mike Luong]

Removed drivers:
----------------------
- Amstrad
- Chess Champion I
- Sinclair ZX Family
- Studio 2

System Driver Changes:
----------------------
- [COCO] The virtual printer should now be responsive to bitbanger output of
  any arbitrary baud. [Nate Woods]

- [COCO] Fixed a OKI M6242B clock emulation problem and a problem with Disto
  Real Time Clock emulation. [tim lindner]

- [COCO] Fixed a very ugly bug that could cause freezups under OS-9 and other
  forms of disk accesses.  This was because interrupts were dropped when the
  CPU is halted. (Bugs #197, #229) [Nate Woods]

- [COCO3] Fixed a bug in the GIME video emulation that caused all parts of
  the $FF9B/D/E video registers to be used in lo-res mode; where in reality
  the low 16 bits are dropped.  This caused a bug in CoCoTracker that caused
  the screen to be garbled after the MOD files are played. [Nate Woods]

- [COCO3] Adjusted composite colors slightly with help from SockMaster (Bug
  #227) [John Kowalski, Nate Woods]
  
- [COCO3] Exposed the two high bits on MMU registers (even though their value
  is undefined) to fix a problem with SockMaster's LSAVEM utility. [Nate Woods]
  
- [COLECO] The Coleco driver now recognizes the *.col extension for Coleco
  cartridges. [Nate Woods]
  
- [SPECPL3E] Updated BIOS to the 1.11 version romset
  (http://www.z88forever.org.uk/zxplus3e/) [Stefano Priore]

- [GAMEBOY] Can now load ROMs that are larger than 2MB. Fixed RAM bank
  switching in MBC3 ROMs. [Anthony Kruize]

- [COUPE] Combined coupe and coupe512 drivers into one driver that uses
  configurable RAM sizes. [Nate Woods]
  
- [A2600] Converted video code from using plot_pixel() to draw_scanline() [Nate
  Woods]
  
- [VTECH1] Converted back to using generic M6847 video hardware module (Bug #36)
  [Nate Woods]

- [SNES] Rewrite of the driver.  Still at a preliminary stage though. Some
  games are playable, others run but aren't playable, however most don't work.
  [Anthony Kruize]
  
- [VECTREX] Because of the MAME core's new artwork system, new .art files are
  now needed in conjunction with the normal Vectrex .png files to specify the
  artwork layout. [Nate Woods]

- [GENESIS] Changed input ports to be consistent with other drivers.
  [Anthony Kruize]

Source Changes:
---------------
- The core is based on MAME 0.61.  This incorporates all features of the 
  update to this core.  [MAME team] 

- Converted numerous drivers to use the auto_malloc() and auto_bitmap_alloc()
  calls, and also to use generic_bitmapped video calls. [Nate Woods]

- Added new videomap code that makes it easy to support arbitrary video modes
  in a fast, efficient manner.  This takes the place of the old
  rasterbits/rastertrack code; converted m6847, CoCo 3, and Mac video hardware
  to use videomap. [Nate Woods]

- Added a new disk format handling system that allows disk formats to be
  generically specified in such a way usable by both MESS itself, and imgtool
  [Nate Woods]

- Fixed a bug in the wave code that could cause a crash if a cassette image is
  unloaded. [Nate Woods]
  
- Added a [none] entry in the File Manager, that allows the user to unload an
  image. [Nate Woods]
  
- The file manager will now default to the directory that a preexisting image
  resides in. [Nate Woods]

- Fixed some bugs that caused the battery backups in the NES and GB systems to
  be placed in odd directories. [Nate Woods]
  
- Added palette_set_colors() function to make it easy to initialize a palette
  with a predefined list of colors. [Nate Woods]
  
- Readded record/playback support. [Nate Woods]

- Added artwork_use_device_art() to the MAME core to support Vectrex style
  artwork. [Nate Woods]

- Fixed bugs #192 and #200 - remember that:

  1) In File Manager you can press SHIFT+ENTER to manually edit a filename
     and CTRL-Y to delete the field.

  2) In the file selector you can edit the file specification and you can use
     SHIFT+UP/DOWN as PgUp/PgDown and
     CTRL+UP/DOWN as Home/End. [Stefano Priore]

- With help from SockMaster, fixed some very subtle timer bugs in the m6809
  and hd6309 CPU cores [Nate Woods, tim lindner, John Kowalski]
  
- New OSD function:

		void osd_device_eject(int type, int id);

  It sets a device image to NULL, as would a device_filename_change(type, id,
  NULL), but enables osd code to update its osd structures.  The mac and lisa
  drivers will use this function instead of device_filename_change to eject
  floppy disks.

  This function is needed because the mac osd code keeps track of each
  selected file, and the data went out of sync when device_filename_change
  was called. [Raphael Nabet]

- [GUI] Fixed a very minor bug that caused the software list view background
  to not be updated at the same time as the system list if the snap directory
  was changed. [Nate Woods]

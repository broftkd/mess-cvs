New System Drivers Supported (in no particular order):
------------------------------------------------------
Dragon 64 [Nate Woods]

System Driver Changes:
----------------------
- [CGENIE] Floppy initialisation fixed for when no floppy attached 
  (Bug #95) [Ben Bruscella]

- [JUPITER] Cartridge and Cassette Initialisation fixed 
  (Bug #126) [Ben Bruscella]

- [A7800] Fixed interrupt handling bug - more carts run again [Ben Bruscella]

- [SPECTRUM] 48k machines are now able to run code in screen memory (Bug #46).
  Fixed problem with interrupt vector set to 0xffff (much more 128k games works
  now). Corrected frames per second value for 48k and 128k Sincalir machines.
  Remaped some Spectrum+ keys. Added support to load .SP snapshots. Added .BLK
  tape images support. [Krzysztof Strzecha]

- [COCO] Converted CoCo drivers to use configurable RAM sizes, and the CoCo 3
  driver now supports the 2 MB upgrade (if I knew the specs, it would be very
  trivial for me to support the 8 MB upgrade). [Nate Woods]

- [PC] Fixed a bug that caused the keyboard buffer to get flooded and the
  emulated system to get paralyzed in beeping under certain situations (bug
  #151). [Nate Woods]

- [TS1000] The main rom file is now called zx81a.rom, instead of zx81.rom in
  order to match the other drivers in the family. [Nate Woods]

Source Changes:
---------------
- The core is based on MAME 0.56.  This incorporates all features of the 
  update to this core.  [MAME team] 

- The core now supports configurable RAM sizes; drivers can expose RAM
  configurations (e.g. 4k, 16k, 32k etc) and on Windows, this setting is
  exposed through a command line switch -ramsize.  [Nate Woods]

- Fixed a bug that prevented introducing completely new software images when
  there was already one of that particular image type already loaded. [Nate
  Woods]

- Added some infrastructure for automated tests. [Nate Woods]

- Fixed a bug in tape handling that would cause rewind and fast forward to not
  work if the system was stopping the tape (bug #168). [Nate Woods]

- [Windows] Fixed a bug in the core that caused the MESS process to not die if
  the close box was pressed, and the UI was disabled (bug #170). [Nate Woods]
 
- [Windows] Fixed a bug in the GUI that caused heap corruptions. [Nate Woods]

- [Windows] Fixed a bug in the GUI that caused auditing to report BIOS-less
  console systems as missing BIOSes. [Nate Woods]

- [IMGTOOL/Windows] Added wildcard support in the put command, since the
  Windows shell doesn't do this by default. [Nate Woods] 
  
- [IMGTOOL/FAT driver] Fixed bug where files would get stored into a FAT image
  without forcing the filename to upper case. [Nate Woods]

System Driver Changes:
----------------------

  (Bug #95) [Ben Bruscella]

- [JUPITER] Cartridge and Cassette Initialisation fixed 
  (Bug #126) [Ben Bruscella]

- [A7800] Fixed interrupt handling bug - more carts run again [Ben Bruscella]

- [SPECTRUM] 48k machines are now able to run code in screen memory (Bug #46).
  Fixed problem with interrupt vector set to 0xffff (much more 128k games works
  now). Corrected frames per second value for 48k and 128k Sincalir machines.
  Remaped some Spectrum+ keys. Added support to load .SP snapshots. Added .BLK
  tape images support. [Krzysztof Strzecha]

- [COCO] Converted CoCo drivers to use configurable RAM sizes. [Nate Woods]

Source Changes:
---------------
- The core is based on MAME 0.56.  This incorporates all features of the 
  update to this core.  [MAME team] 

- The core now supports configurable RAM sizes; drivers can expose RAM
  configurations (e.g. 4k, 16k, 32k etc) and on Windows, this setting is
  exposed through a command line switch -ramsize.  [Nate Woods]

- Fixed a bug that prevented introducing completely new software images when
  there was already one of that particular image type already loaded. [Nate
  Woods]

- Added infrastructure for automated tests. [Nate Woods]

- Fixed a bug in tape handling that would cause rewind and fast forward to not
  work if the system was stopping the tape (bug #168). [Nate Woods]

- [Windows] Fixed a bug in the core that caused the MESS process to not die if
  the close box was pressed, and the UI was disabled (bug #170). [Nate Woods]

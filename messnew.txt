- [ATARI/APPLE2] Converted a few malloc() calls over to use auto_malloc()
  [Nate Woods]
  
- [COCO] The virtual printer should now be responsive to bitbanger output of
  any arbitrary baud. [Nate Woods]

Source Changes:
---------------
- The core is based on MAME 0.60.  This incorporates all features of the 
  update to this core.  [MAME team] 

- Added new videomap code that makes it easy to support arbitrary video modes
  in a fast, efficient manner.  This takes the place of the old
  rasterbits/rastertrack code; converted m6847, CoCo 3, and Mac video hardware
  to use videomap. [Nate Woods]

- Fixed a bug in the wave code that could cause a crash if a cassette image is
  unloaded. [Nate Woods]
  
- Added a [none] entry in the File Manager, that allows the user to unload an
  image. [Nate Woods]
  
- The file manager will now default to the directory that a preexisting image
  resides in. [Nate Woods]

- Fixed some bugs that caused the battery backups in the NES and GB systems to
  be placed in odd directories. [Nate Woods]
  
- Added palette_set_colors() function to make it easy to initialize a palette
  with a predefined list of colors. [Nate Woods]

- Fixed bugs #192 and #200 - remember that:

  1) In File Manager you can press SHIFT+ENTER to manually edit a filename
     and CTRL-Y to delete the field.

  2) In the file selector you can edit the file specification and you can use
     SHIFT+UP/DOWN as PgUp/PgDown and
     CTRL+UP/DOWN as Home/End. [Stefano Priore]

Noise table optimization proposed by Phillip Wooller. The output of
each table does not differ.

CoCo disk controller code (src/mess/machine/cocodisk.c) based on code from 
the PC-Dragon emulator by Paul Burgin and Stewart Orchard.

MESS and imgtool uses XSA code developed by Alex Wulms/XelSoft.

XelaSoft Archive decompression in imgtool and the MSX driver is heavily
based on xsd, written by Alex Wulms/XelaSoft (mess/formats/xsa.c).

	http://web.inter.nl.net/users/A.P.Wulms/

From the readme.1st:

These sources may be used by any one who wants to support the XSA format,
for example in an MSX emulator, provided the following conditions are met:
1) You have to put the following phrase in the documentation of the program
   in which you use the XSA code:
     <program reference> uses XSA code developed by Alex Wulms/XelaSoft
   Notice that you can replace <program reference> with the name of your
   program, for example 'The MSX emulator'.
2) You do not make any changes to the XSA code that can impact the
   compatibility with the XSA format. Special attention should be paid to
   the compression routine. When the compression routine is changed, for
   example for performance reasons, then you must make sure that the newly
   compressed files can be uncompressed on an MSX system in a 64KB address
   space.

To comply to the rules: 1) see above; 2) only decompression is supported.
